# TAMU-datathon-2025
Code repo for the tamu datathon: MCP Challenge

Our goal is to make a chatbot using our MCP data specifically made for TAMU college students.
Our MCP will provide context about:
- Sports
- Food
- Apartments
- Classes
- Events
- Student organizations

Additionally, we want to give our model ability to perform actions:
- Write to Google calendar
- Writing and sending emails (to professors and clubs)
